## Gotchas
- **Fallback Masquerading**: Broker-level fallbacks can mask API/credential failures during tests/validations. Always set `disableFallback: true` in diagnostics, matrix, or environment check scripts to expose genuine rate limits, auth errors, or credit exhaustion.
- **Workflow Template Interpolation**: Shell validation commands in workflows (not just agent prompts) must render template variables (e.g. `{{inputs.filename}}`) before execution.
- **Gemini Structured Output** — Gemini CLI does not support JSON Schema output natively. The broker must perform client-side schema validation on the stdout payload.
- **Agy Capabilities** — Agy CLI does not support schemas or images. Reject requests requesting these capabilities in the broker before dispatch.
- **CLI Path Validation** — Always assert that provider binaries are on the user's `PATH` before invoking them to avoid cryptic execution failures.
- **Safe Pushing & Clean** — Git push or branch reset/clean commands require explicit user confirmation.

## Commands
